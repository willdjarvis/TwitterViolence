Track dangerous tweets in your area! 
Hey guys, this can find violent tweets in your area. You just need to create your own twitter app, (find out more by googling tweepy) and enter your authentication and customer key. Once you finish that, you'll need to create your own violent keywords, and own expletives. These vary from locaiton to location.

Contact me if you have any questions!
